  Integration </font></B></h1>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>Many 
  real problems cannot be solved by the simple application of a single expert 
  system technique. Problems often require multiple knowledge representation techniques 
  as well as conventional programming techniques.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>Often 
  times it is necessary to either have the expert system embedded in a conventional 
  application, or to have other applications callable from the expert system. 
  For example, a financial expert system might need a tight integration with a 
  spread sheet, or an engineering expert system might need access to programs 
  which perform engineering calculations.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>The 
  degree to which the systems in this book can be integrated with other environments 
  depends on the flexibility of the Prolog used, and the application which needs 
  to be accessed. The systems can be designed with the hooks in place for this 
  integration. In the examples presented in this chapter, the knowledge base tools 
  will have hooks to Prolog.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>Often 
  times the Prolog code can be used to implement features of the system that do 
  not fit neatly in the knowledge tools. This is often the case in the area of 
  user interface, but applies to other portions as well. In the example in this 
  chapter, we will see Prolog used to smooth over a number of the rough edges 
  of the application.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>The 
  degree of integration needed between knowledge tools also depends somewhat on 
  the application. In this chapter, the forward chaining system and frame based 
  knowledge representation will be tightly integrated. By having control over 
  the tools, the degree of integration can be implemented to suit the individual 
  application.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>The 
  example used in this chapter is the same room furniture placement used in the 
  chapter on forward chaining. While the application was developed with the pure 
  Oops system, a much more elegant solution can be implemented by integrating 
  frames, Oops, and Prolog. In particular, there is a lot of knowledge about the 
  types of furniture which could be better stored in a frame system. Also the 
  awkward input and output sections of the system could be better written in Prolog.</FONT></P>

  Foops (Frames and Oops) </font></B></h2>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>The 
  first step is to integrate the frame based knowledge representation with the 
  Oops forward chaining inference engine. The integration occurs in two places:</FONT></P>

</DIR>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>The 
  instances are needed for an integrated system to distinguish between the frame 
  data definition in the knowledge base, and the instances of frames in working 
  storage. The rules will be matching and manipulating instances of frames, rather 
  than the frame definitions themselves. For example, there will be a frame describing 
  the attributes of chairs, but there might be multiple instances of chairs in 
  working storage.</FONT></P>
<h3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook"><a name="instances"></a>Instances</FONT></B></h3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>In 
  the frame system as it is currently written, the frames are the data. Particular 
  instances of a frame, such as person, are just additional frames. For use in 
  the expert system it is cleaner to distinguish between frame definitions and 
  instances of frames.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>The 
  definitions specify the slots for a frame, and the instances provide specific 
  values for the slots. The frame instances will be updated in working storage 
  and accessed by the rules. For example, <B>person</B> would be a frame definition, 
  and <B>mary</B> would be an instance of <B>person</B>.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>The 
  inheritance still works as before. That is, a <B>person</B> frame could be defined 
  as well as <B>man</B> and <B>woman</B> frames which inherit from <B>person</B>. 
  In this case then <B>mary</B> would be an instance of <B>woman</B>, inheriting 
  from both the <B>woman</B> frame and the <B>person</B> frame.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>The 
  <B>frame</B> definitions will be considered to define <B>class</B>es of things. 
  So, <B>person</B>, <B>man</B>, and <B>woman</B> are classes defined in <B>frame</B> 
  relations. Individuals, such as <B>mary</B>, <B>dennis</B>, <B>michael</B>, 
  and <B>diana</B> are stored as instances of these classes.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>To 
  implement the instances, we need a data structure, and predicates to manipulate 
  the data structure. An instance of a frame looks a lot like a frame, and will 
  be stored in the relation <B>frinst/4</B>. The four arguments will be:</FONT></P>
