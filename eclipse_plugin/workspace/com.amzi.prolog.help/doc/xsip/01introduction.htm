  Introduction </font></B></h1>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>Over 
  the past several years there have been many implementations of expert systems 
  using various tools and various hardware platforms, from powerful LISP machine 
  workstations to smaller personal computers.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>The 
  technology has left the confines of the academic world and has spread through 
  many commercial institutions. People wanting to explore the technology and experiment 
  with it have a bewildering selection of tools from which to choose. There continues 
  to be a debate as to whether or not it is best to write expert systems using 
  a high-level shell, an AI language such as LISP or Prolog, or a conventional 
  language such as C.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>This 
  book is designed to teach you how to build expert systems from the inside out. 
  It presents the various features used in expert systems, shows how to implement 
  them in Prolog, and how to use them to solve problems.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>The 
  code presented in this book is a foundation from which many types of expert 
  systems can be built. It can be modified and tuned for particular applications. 
  It can be used for rapid prototyping. It can be used as an educational laboratory 
  for experimenting with expert system concepts.</FONT></P>

  Expert Systems </font></B></h2>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>Expert 
  systems are computer applications which embody some non-algorithmic expertise 
  for solving certain types of problems. For example, expert systems are used 
  in diagnostic applications servicing both people and machinery. They also play 
  chess, make financial planning decisions, configure computers, monitor real 
  time systems, underwrite insurance policies, and perform many other services 
  which previously required human expertise.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>Many 
  expert systems are built with products called expert system shells. The shell 
  is a piece of software which contains the user interface, a format for declarative 
  knowledge in the knowledge base, and an inference engine. The knowledge engineer 
  uses the shell to build a system for a particular problem domain.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>Expert 
  systems are also built with shells that are custom developed for particular 
  applications. In this case there is another key individual:</FONT></P>

</DIR>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>Depending 
  on the size of the project, the knowledge engineer and the system engineer might 
  be the same person. For a custom built system, the design of the format of the 
  knowledge base, and the coding of the domain knowledge are closely related. 
  The format has a significant effect on the coding of the knowledge.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>One 
  of the major bottlenecks in building expert systems is the knowledge engineering 
  process. The coding of the expertise into the declarative rule format can be 
  a difficult and tedious task. One major advantage of a customized shell is that 
  the format of the knowledge base can be designed to facilitate the knowledge 
  engineering process.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>The 
  objective of this design process is to reduce the semantic gap. Semantic gap 
  refers to the difference between the natural representation of some knowledge 
  and the programmatic representation of that knowledge. For example, compare 
  the semantic gap between a mathematical formula and its representation in both 
  assembler and FORTRAN. FORTRAN code (for formulas) has a smaller semantic gap 
  and is therefor easier to work with.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>Since 
  the major bottleneck in expert system development is the building of the knowledge 
  base, it stands to reason that the semantic gap between the expert's representation 
  of the knowledge and the representation in the knowledge base should be minimized. 
  With a customized system, the system engineer can implement a knowledge base 
  whose structures are as close as possible to those used by the domain expert.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>This 
  book concentrates primarily on the techniques used by the system engineer and 
  knowledge engineer to design customized systems. It explains the various types 
  of inference engines and knowledge bases that can be designed, and how to build 
  and use them. It tells how they can be mixed together for some problems, and 
  customized to meet the needs of a given application.</FONT></P>

  Reasoning</FONT></B></h3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>Goal-driven 
  reasoning, or backward chaining, is an efficient way to solve problems that 
  can be modelled as "structured selection" problems. That is, the aim of the 
  system is to pick the best choice from many enumerated possibilities. For example, 
  an identification problem falls in this category. Diagnostic systems also fit 
  this model, since the aim of the system is to pick the correct diagnosis.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>The 
  knowledge is structured in rules which describe how each of the possibilities 
  might be selected. The rule breaks the problem into sub-problems. For example, 
  the following top level rules are in a system which identifies birds.</FONT></P>
<DIR> 
  <DIR> 
    <P><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2><B>IF<BR>
      family is albatross and<BR>

    <P><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2><B>THEN<BR>
      bird is laysan albatross.</B></FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2><B>IF<BR>
      family is albatross and<BR>
      color is dark</B></FONT></P>
    <P><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2><B>THEN<BR>
      bird is black footed albatross.</B></FONT></P>
  </DIR>
</DIR>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>The 
  system would try all of the rules which gave information satisfying the goal 
  of identifying the bird. Each would trigger sub-goals. In the case of these 
  two rules, the sub-goals of determining the family and the color would be pursued. 
  The following rule is one that satisfies the family sub-goal:</FONT></P>

  <DIR> 
    <P><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2><B>IF<BR>

  </DIR>
</DIR>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>The 
  sub-goals of determining color, size, and wings would be satisfied by asking 
  the user. By having the lowest level sub-goal satisfied or denied by the user, 
  the system effectively carries on a dialog with the user. The user sees the 
  system asking questions and responding to answers as it attempts to find the 
  rule which correctly identifies the bird.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>Often 
  times in structured selection problems the final answer is not known with complete 
  certainty. The expert's rules might be vague, and the user might be unsure of 
  answers to questions. This can be easily seen in medical diagnostic systems 
  where the expert is not able to be definite about the relationship between symptoms 
  and diseases. In fact, the doctor might offer multiple possible diagnoses.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>For 
  expert systems to work in the real world they must also be able to deal with 
  uncertainty. One of the simplest schemes is to associate a numeric value with 
  each piece of information in the system. The numeric value represents the certainty 
  with which the information is known. There are numerous ways in which these 
  numbers can be defined, and how they are combined during the inference process.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>For 
  many problems it is not possible to enumerate all of the possible answers before 
  hand and have the system select the correct one. For example, configuration 
  problems fall in this category. These systems might put components in a computer, 
  design circuit boards, or lay out office space. Since the inputs vary and can 
  be combined in an almost infinite number of ways, the goal driven approach will 
  not work.</FONT></P>

    <TD VALIGN="TOP"> 
      <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>The 
        data driven approach, or forward chaining, uses rules similar to those 
        used for backward chaining, however, the inference process is different. 
        The system keeps track of the current state of problem solution and looks 
        for rules which will move that state closer to a final solution.</FONT>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>A 
  system to layout living room furniture would begin with a problem state consisting 
  of a number of unplaced pieces of furniture. Various rules would be responsible 
  for placing the furniture in the room, thus changing the problem state. When 
  all of the furniture was placed, the system would be finished, and the output 
  would be the final state. Here is a rule from such a system which places the 
  television opposite the couch.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>This 
  rule would take a problem state with an unplaced television and transform it 
  to a state that had the television placed on the opposite wall from the couch. 
  Since the television is now placed, this rule will not fire again. Other rules 
  for other furniture will fire until the furniture arrangement task is finished.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>Note 
  that for a data driven system, the system must be initially populated with data, 
  in contrast to the goal driven system which gathers data as it needs it. Figure 
  1.2 illustrates the difference between forward and backward chaining systems 
  for two simplified rules. The forward chaining system starts with the data of 
  <B>a=1</B> and <B>b=2</B> and uses the rules to derive <B>d=4</B>. The backward 
  chaining system starts with the goal of finding a value for <B>d</B> and uses 
  the two rules to reduce that to the problem of finding values for <B>a</B> and 
  <B>b</B>.</FONT></P>

  Representation</FONT></B></h3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>For 
  all rule based systems, the rules refer to data. The data representation can 
  be simple or complex, depending on the problem. The four levels described in 
  this section are illustrated in figure 1.3.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>The 
  most fundamental scheme uses attribute-value pairs as seen in the rules for 
  identifying birds. Examples are color-white, and size-large.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>When 
  a system is reasoning about multiple objects, it is necessary to include the 
  object as well as the attribute-value. For example the furniture placement system 
  might be dealing with multiple chairs with different attributes, such as size. 
  The data representation in this case must include the object.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>Once 
  there are objects in the system, they each might have multiple attributes. This 
  leads to a record-based structure where a single data item in working storage 
  contains an object name and all of its associated attribute-value pairs.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>Frames 
  are a more complex way of storing objects and their attribute-values. Frames 
  add intelligence to the data representation, and allow objects to inherit values 
  from other objects. Furthermore, each of the attributes can have associated 
  with it procedures (called demons) which are executed when the attribute is 
  asked for, or updated.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>In 
  a furniture placement system each piece of furniture can inherit default values 
  for length. When the piece is placed, demons are activated which automatically 
  adjust the available space where the item was placed.</FONT></P>

  Interface</FONT></B></h3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>The 
  acceptability of an expert system depends to a great extent on the quality of 
  the user interface. The easiest to implement interfaces communicate with the 
  user through a scrolling dialog as illustrated in figure 1.4. The user can enter 
  commands, and respond to questions. The system responds to commands, and asks 
  questions during the inferencing process.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>More 
  advanced interfaces make heavy use of pop-up menus, windows, mice, and similar 
  techniques as shown in figure 1.5. If the machine supports it, graphics can 
  also be a powerful tool for communicating with the user. This is especially 
  true for the development interface which is used by the knowledge engineer in 
  building the system.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>One 
  of the more interesting features of expert systems is their ability to explain 
  themselves. Given that the system knows which rules were used during the inference 
  process, it is possible for the system to provide those rules to the user as 
  a means for explaining the results.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>This 
  type of explanation can be very dramatic for some systems such as the bird identification 
  system. It could report that it knew the bird was a black footed albatross because 
  it knew it was dark colored and an albatross. It could similarly justify how 
  it knew it was an albatross.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>At 
  other times, however, the explanations are relatively useless to the user. This 
  is because the rules of an expert system typically represent empirical knowledge, 
  and not a deep understanding of the problem domain. For example a car diagnostic 
  system has rules which relate symptoms to problems, but no rules which describe 
  why those symptoms are related to those problems.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>Explanations 
  are always of extreme value to the knowledge engineer. They are the program 
  traces for knowledge bases. By looking at explanations the knowledge engineer 
  can see how the system is behaving, and how the rules and data are interacting. 
  This is an invaluable diagnostic tool during development.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>The 
  details of building expert systems are illustrated in this book through the 
  use of Prolog code. There is a small semantic gap between Prolog code and the 
  logical specification of a program. This means the description of a section 
  of code, and the code are relatively similar. Because of the small semantic 
  gap, the code examples are shorter and more concise than they might be with 
  another language.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>The 
  expressiveness of Prolog is due to three major features of the language: rule-based 
  programming, built-in pattern matching, and backtracking execution. The rule-based 
  programming allows the program code to be written in a form which is more declarative 
  than procedural. This is made possible by the built-in pattern matching and 
  backtracking which automatically provide for the flow of control in the program. 
  Together these features make it possible to elegantly implement many types of 
  expert systems.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>There 
  are also arguments in favor of using conventional languages, such as C, for 
  building expert system shells. Usually these arguments center around issues 
  of portability, performance, and developer experience. As newer versions of 
  commercial Prologs have increased sophistication, portability, and performance, 
  the advantages of C over Prolog decrease. However, there will always be a need 
  for expert system tools in other languages. (One mainframe expert system shell 
  is written entirely in COBOL.) </FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>For 
  those seeking to build systems in other languages, this book is still of value. 
  Since the Prolog code is close to the logical specification of a program, it 
  can be used as the basis for implementation in another language.</FONT></P>

  Assumptions </font></B></h2>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>This 
  book is written with the assumption that the reader understands Prolog programming. 
  If not, <I>Programming in Prolog</I> by Clocksin and Mellish from Springer-Verlag 
  is the classic Prolog text. <I>APT - The Active Prolog Tutor</I> by the author 
  and published by Solution Systems in South Weymouth, Massachusetts is an interactive 
  PC based tutorial that includes a practice Prolog interpreter.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>An in depth understanding 
  of expert systems is not required, but the reader will probably find it useful 
  to explore other texts. In particular since this book focuses on system engineering, 
  readings in knowledge engineering would provide complementary information. Some 
  good books in this area are: <I>Building Expert Systems</I> by Hayes-Roth, Waterman, 
  and Lenat; <I>Rule-Based Expert Systems</I> by Buchanan and Shortliffe; and 
  <I>Programming Expert Systems</I> <I>in OPS5</I> by Brownston, Kant, Farrell, 
  and Martin.</FONT></P>
