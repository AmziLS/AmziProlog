      The Eclipse plug-ins for developing and debugging programs in
Amzi! Prolog. If you intend to use the command line tools, or if you are running your own
copy of Eclipse that was not installed with Amzi!, then the environment variable, AMZI_DIR, should be set
and point to a currently installed version of Amzi! core directory (e.g. c:\program files\amzi\apls). In that case AMZI_DIR/bin should be on the PATH as well.
