  Forward Chaining </font></B></h1>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>This 
  chapter discusses a forward chaining rule based system and its expert system 
  applications. It shows how the forward chaining system works, how to use it, 
  and how to implement it quickly and easily using Prolog.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>A 
  large number of expert systems require the use of forward chaining, or data 
  driven inference. The most famous of these is Digital Equipment Corporation's 
  XCON system. It configures computers. It starts with the data about the customer 
  order and works forward toward a configuration based on that data. The XCON 
  system was written in the OPS5 (forward chaining rule based) language.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>Data 
  driven expert systems are different from the goal driven, or backward chaining 
  systems seen in the previous chapters.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>The 
  goal driven approach is practical when there are a reasonable number of possible 
  final answers, as in the case of a diagnostic or identification system. The 
  system methodically tries to prove or disprove each possible answer, gathering 
  the needed information as it goes.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>The 
  data driven approach is practical when combinatorial explosion creates a seemingly 
  infinite number of possible right answers, such as possible configurations of 
  a machine.</FONT></P>

  chaining systems are often called "production" systems. Each of the rules is

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>In 
  the Winston &amp; Horn LISP book there is an example of a forward chaining animal

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>When 
  the rule fired, these three terms would be removed by the <B>retract(all)</B>

</DIR>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>Since

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>Rules

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>It

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>Now 
  that we have a list of possible rules and instantiations in the conflict set, 
  it is necessary to select one. First we will look at the OPS5 LEX method of 
  rule selection. It uses three criteria to select a rule.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>The 
  first is refraction. This discards any instantiations which have already been 
  fired. Two instantiations are the same if the variable bindings and the time 
  stamps are the same. This prevents the same rule from firing over and over, 
  unless the programmer has caused working memory to be repeatedly updated with 
  the same fact.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>The 
  second is recency. This choses the rules which use the most recent elements 
  in working memory. The conflict set rules are ordered with those rules with 
  the highest time stamps first. This is useful to give the system a sense of 
  focus as it works on a problem. Facts which are just asserted will most likely 
  be used next in a rule.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>The 
  third is specificity. If there are still multiple rules in contention, the most 
  specific is used. The more conditions there are that apply in the LHS of the 
  rule, the more specific it is. For example, a rule with 4 conditions is more 
  specific than one with 3 conditions. This criteria ensures that general case 
  rules will fire after more specific case rules.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>If 
  after these tests there are still multiple rules which apply, then one is chosen 
  at random.</FONT></P>

  version of Oops, the knowledge engineer had to make sure that the working storage

  responsibility to ensure that a rule did not repeatedly fire.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>The

  must be structured to fire first. This can be done by adding a goal to place 
  the couch first and asserting it after the data is gathered. For example:</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>The

  examples illustrate some of the difficulties with expert systems in general.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>On 
  the other hand, if the programmer has access to the selection strategy code,

  is easy to experiment with different selection strategies.</FONT></P>

  the conflict set and dynamically change the rule priorities. Figure out an application

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>5.6 
  - Add new syntax to the knowledge base that allows rules to be clustered into 
  rule sets. Maintain separate conflict sets for each rule set and have the inference 
  engine process each rule set to completion. Have higher level rules which can 
  be used to decide which rule sets to execute. Alternatively, each rule set can 
  have an enabling pattern associated with it that allows it to fire just as individual 
  rules are fired.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>5.7 - Each fact in 
  working storage can be thought of as being dependent on other facts. The other 
  facts are those which instantiated the LHS of a rule which udpated the fact. 
  By keeping track of these dependencies, a form of truth maintenance can be added 
  to the system. When a fact is then removed from working storage, the system 
  can find other facts which were dependent on it and remove them as well.</FONT></P>
