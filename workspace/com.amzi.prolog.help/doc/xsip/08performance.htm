  Performance </font></B></h1>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>As 
  the size of a knowledge base grows, performance becomes more problematic. The 
  inference engines we have looked at so far use a simple pattern matching algorithm 
  to find the rules to fire. Various indexing schemes can be used to speed up 
  that pattern matching process.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>The 
  indexing problem is different for forward and backward chaining systems. Backward 
  chaining systems need to be accessed by the goal pattern in the right hand side 
  of the rule. Forward chaining systems need to be indexed by the more complex 
  patterns on the left hand side. Backward chaining issues will be discussed briefly 
  in this chapter, followed by more in depth treatment of a simplified Rete match 
  algorithm for the Foops forward chaining system.</FONT></P>

  Backward Chaining Indexes </font></B></h2>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>For 
  performance in backward chaining systems, the rules are indexed by goal patterns 
  on the right hand side. In particular, if the goal is to find a value for a 
  given attribute, then the rules should be indexed by the attribute set in the 
  RHS of the rule. This happens automatically for the pure Prolog rules in the 
  bird identification program since the attributes are Prolog predicate names 
  which are generally accessed through hashing algorithms. The indices, if desired, 
  must be built into the backward chaining engine used in Clam. Some Prologs provide 
  automatic indexing on the first argument of a predicate. This feature could 
  be used to provide the required performance.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>Given 
  indexing by the first argument, the rules in Clam would be represented:</FONT></P>
<DIR> 
  <DIR> 
    <P><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2><B>rule(Attribute, 
      Val, CF, Name, LHS).</B></FONT></P>
  </DIR>
</DIR>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>This 
  way, a search for rules providing values for a given attribute would quickly 
  find the appropriate rules.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>Without 
  this, each rule could be represented with a functor based on the goal pattern 
  and accessed using the univ (=..) predicate rather than the pattern matching 
  currently used in Clam. The predicates which initially read the rules can store 
  them using this scheme. For example, the internal format of the Clam rules would 
  be:</FONT></P>

  <DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>In

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>When

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>OPS5 
  and some high-end expert system shells use the Rete match algorithm to optimize 
  performance. It is an indexing scheme which allows for rapid matching of changes 
  in working memory with the rules. Previous match information is saved on each 
  cycle, so the system avoids redundant calculations. We will implement a simplified 
  version of the Rete algorithm for Foops.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>The 
  Rete algorithm is designed for matching left hand side rule patterns against 
  working storage elements. Let's look at two similar rules from the room placement 
  expert system.</FONT></P>

      [update(end_table - T with [position-wall/OW]), <BR>
      update(tv - TV with [position-end_table/T])].</B></FONT></P>
  </DIR>
</DIR>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>First 
  let's define some terms. Each LHS is composed of one or more frame patterns. 
  An example of a frame pattern is:</FONT></P>
<DIR> 
  <DIR> 
    <P><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2><B>tv-TV with 
      [position-none, place_on-table]</B></FONT></P>
  </DIR>
</DIR>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>The 
  frame pattern will be the basic unit of indexing in the simplified Rete match 
  algorithm. In a full implementation, indexing is carried down to the individual 
  attribute-value pairs within the frame pattern, such as <B>place_on-table</B>.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>The 
  match algorithm used in the first implementation of Foops takes every rule and 
  compares it to all the frame instances on each cycle. In particular, both of 
  the example rules above would be compared against working storage on each cycle. 
  Not only is redundant matching being done on each cycle, within each cycle the 
  same frame patterns are being matched twice, once for each rule. Since working 
  memory generally has few changes on each cycle, and since many of the rules 
  have redundant patterns, this approach is very inefficient.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>With 
  the Rete algorithm, the status of the match information from one cycle is remembered 
  for the next. The indexing allows the algorithm to update only that match information 
  which is changed due to working memory changes.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>The 
  rules are compiled into a network structure where the nodes correspond to the 
  frame patterns in the LHS of the rules. There are three basic types of node 
  which serve as: the entry to the network; the internals of the network; and 
  the exit from the network. These are called root nodes, two-input nodes, and 
  rule nodes respectively.</FONT></P>

</FONT> 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>The

  Network Nodes</FONT></B></h3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>The 
  root nodes serve as entry points to the Rete network. They are the simplest 
  patterns recognized by the network, in this case the frame patterns that appear 
  in the various rules. A frame pattern only appears once in a root node even 
  if it is referenced in multiple rules. Each root node has pointers to two-input 
  nodes which are used to combine the patterns into full LHS patterns.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>Two-input 
  nodes represent partially completed LHS patterns. The left input has a pattern 
  which has one or more frame patterns as they appear in one or more rules. The 
  right input has a single frame pattern, which when appended to the left input 
  pattern completes more of a full LHS pattern. The two-input node is linked to 
  other two-input or rule nodes whose left input matches the larger pattern. </FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>The 
  rule nodes are the exit points of the Rete network. They have full LHS patterns

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>Associated 
  with each two-input node, are copies of working storage elements which have 
  already matched either side of the node. These are called the left and right

  network itself.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>Whenever 
  a frame instance is added, deleted, or updated it is converted to a "token". 
  A token is formed by comparing the frame instance to the root patterns. A root 
  pattern which is unified with the frame instance is a token. The token has an 
  additional element which indicates whether it is to be added to or deleted from 
  the network.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>The 
  token is sent from the root node to its successor nodes. If the token matches 
  a left or right pattern of a two-input successor node, it is added (or deleted) 
  from the the appropriate memory for that node. The token is then combined with 
  each token from the memory on the other side (right or left) and compared with 
  the pattern formed by combining the left and right patterns of the two input 
  node. If there is a match, the new combined token is sent to the successor nodes. 
  This process continues until either a rule is instantiated or there are no more 
  matches.</FONT></P>

  left memory of two-input node #1. Then the frame instance wall-north with [opposite-south, 
  left-west, right-east] is added, causing the generation of the token wall-north 
  with [opposite-south]. The token updates the right memory of node #1 as shown,

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>Next,

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>After 
  initialization, the system starts to fire rules. One of the early rules in the

  [position-none]</B> from parts of the network not shown in the diagrams, and 
  the addition of the token <B>couch-1 with [position-wall/north]</B> to the left

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>Node 
  #1 now has both left and right memories filled in, so the system tries to combine

  The Rule Compiler </font></B></h2>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>The 
  rule compiler builds the Rete network from the rules. The compiler predicates 
  are not as straight forward as the predicates which propagate tokens through 
  the network. This is one of the rare cases where the power of Prolog's pattern 
  matching actually gets in the way, and code needs to be written to overcome 
  it.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>The 
  very unification which makes the pattern matching propagation predicates easy 
  to code gets in the way of the rule compiler. We allow variables in the rules, 
  which behave as normal Prolog variables, but when the network is built, we need 
  to know which rules are matching variables and which are matching atoms. For 
  example, one rule might have the pattern <B>wall/W</B> and another might have 
  <B>wall/east</B>. These should generate two different indices when building 
  the network, but Prolog would not distinguish between them since they unify 
  with each other.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>In 
  order to distinguish between the variables and atoms in the frame patterns, 
  we must pick the pattern apart first, binding the variables to special atoms 
  as we go. Once all of the variables have been instantiated in this fashion, 
  the patterns can be compared.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>But 
  first, let's look at the bigger picture. Each rule is compared, frame pattern 
  by frame pattern, against the network which has been developed from the rules 
  previously processed. The frame patterns of the rule are sent through the network 
  in a similar fashion to the propagation of tokens. If the frame patterns in 
  the rule are accounted for in the network, nothing is done. If a pattern is 
  not in the network, then the network is updated to include it.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>There 
  are a number of design tradeoffs made in this version. The first is the classic 
  space versus speed tradeoff. At each Rete memory, a full copy of each token 
  is saved. This allows it to be retrieved and matched quickly during execution. 
  Much space could be saved by only storing pointers to the working memory elements. 
  These would have to be retrieved and the token reconstructed when needed.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>The 
  other tradeoff is with the flexibility of the frame system. With the frames 
  in the original Foops, the frame patterns in the rules could take advantage 
  of inheritance and general classes as in the rules which determined a need for 
  electrical plugs in a room. Since Rete-Foops instantiates the patterns before 
  propagating tokens through the network, this does not work. This feature could 
  be incorporated but would add to the burden and complexity of maintaining the 
  network.</FONT></P>
