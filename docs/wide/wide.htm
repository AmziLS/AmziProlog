<h1><A NAME="AQuickTutorial"></A><FONT COLOR="#D2AA00">Quick Tutorial</FONT> </h1>
<P>This section is a tutorial introduction to the Amzi! Prolog development
tools. It is not intended to be an introduction to Prolog. If you need
an introduction to the Prolog language we recommend <I>Adventure in Prolog</I>.
</P>

<P>The tutorial makes use of a simple adventure game, Duck World, to illustrate
how to use the Amzi! tools to build complex applications. Accordingly,
it is composed of a number of files. </P>

<P><IMG SRC="arrowrt.gif" HEIGHT=18 WIDTH=18 ALIGN=BOTTOM> <I>(Why Duck
World? Because Amzi! inc. is located in an old farm house backed up on
conservation land. We bought ducks out of whimsy one day, which were later
discovered by the fox in the woods. The ducks have proved to be an adventure.)</I>
</P>

<P>The tutorial demonstrates both the command-line (alis) and Windows-IDE
interfaces to Amzi! Prolog. </P>

<P>This tutorial starts by testing some of the basic predicates of Duck
World in the listener. It then goes through the full example, showing how
the program is modularized, how it is compiled and run using the listener,
and how it is linked into a distributable application. </P>

<P>The source code for Duck World can be found in the samples/prolog/ducks sub-directory.

<P><!AMZI_INDEX = Tutorial; Duck World>An adventure game is a simulation
of an environment, real or imagined, that the user explores, usually with
some goal in mind. Duck World is a simple adventure game, where the objective
is to go from the house, through the yard, to the duck pen to get an egg,
and back to the house again, without losing any ducks to the fox. </P>

<P>The commands for manipulating the environment are all entered as legal
Prolog goals (ending in periods). </P>

<P>They are: </P>

<MENU>
<LI>goto(X) - moves you to place X, where X can be either house, yard or
pen. </LI>

<LI>take(X) - takes something if it's where you are; the egg is the only
thing you're supposed to take. </LI>

<LI>chase(ducks) - how to get the ducks back in their pen. </LI>

<LI>quit - this, or any illegal command, will quit the game for you. </LI>
</MENU>

<P>When you have brought the egg into the house the game ends. </P>

use the built-in IDE editor, or, under DOS, invoke the editor of your choice.

between sessions, so you begin a new IDE session by simply selecting Reconsult.

<P>This code can be added to the source file and the development process
continues. This is the normal way to develop a Prolog application. Predicates
are gradually added to the source file as the application grows. The application

predicates can be tested and their execution traced to understand why the
application is working the way it does. </P>

<P><!AMZI_INDEX = Tutorial; Modules; Duck World; consult; loc; main; dynamic; goto>As
an application grows, it is natural to want to break it up into modules.
At the simplest this means splitting the predicate definitions among various
source files. These files can be <B>consult</B>ed together and the application
run from the listener. </P>

<P>However, it is often preferred to keep some of the predicates hidden
within a file and to allow only certain predicates to be called from other
source files. This is done through two compiler directives (specified by
:- in the source code), import and export. These directives specify which
predicates will be visible outside of the source file (export), and which
predicates the file is calling that it expects to find elsewhere (import).
</P>

<P>Included in the samples are two source files that illustrate this idea.
They are: </P>

<ul>
  <li>duck1.pro - the source code implementing the commands. </li>
  <li>duck2.pro - the source code for the main control loop. </li>
</ul>
<P>Even for compiled applications, there are usually at least a few predicates
which remain in the dynamic database. It is often convenient to separate
their definition to a separate file that also initializes them by <B>assert</B>ing
them into the dynamic database when the program starts up. </P>

<P>In the case of Duck World, the <B>loc/2</B> predicate is constantly
being changed by the application and therefore is kept in the dynamic database.
The file DUCKENV.PRO contains the code to initialize the database. Notice
that it is <B>consult</B>ed when <B>main/0</B> is called. </P>

<P>If you want to keep a dynamic predicate's definition in with compiled
code, you can use the <B>dynamic</B> directive. It tells the compiler to
keep the specified predicate in the dynamic database, rather than comiling
it. </P>

<P>For example, in this code <B>loc/2</B> will be in the dynamic database
while <B>main</B> and <B>goto</B> are compiled. dynamic is ignored for
interpreted code. </P>

command line, alis first tries to call <B>main/0</B> before establishing
the listener environment. This means that alis can be used to launch your

<h1><A NAME="TheDebugger"></A><FONT COLOR="#D2AA00">Debugger</FONT> </h1>
<P><!AMZI_INDEX = Debugger>Amzi! Prolog includes a debugger, based on the Clocksin 
  &amp; Mellish box-model of Prolog execution, that allows you to trace and interact 
  with interpreted clauses as they are running. It is run from the <A HREF="wide_overview.htm">Windows-IDE</A> 
  using menu commands and dialog boxes, and from <A HREF="pro/prlisten.htm">alis</A> 
  using built-in predicates. </P>

<H2><A NAME="BoxModelofProcedureFlow"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Box Model</FONT></H2>

<P><!AMZI_INDEX = Procedure Flow; Box Model; call; exit; fail; redo; leash; Creep; Leap>The
box model of Prolog execution is a conceptual tool that gives a procedural
interpretation of flow-of-control through a Prolog program. As such it
is useful for understanding the execution of a program. To use the box
model envision each Prolog goal surrounded by a box: </P>

<blockquote>
  <p><IMG SRC="boxmdl.gif" HEIGHT=152 WIDTH=370> </p>
</blockquote>
<P>Each box has four <I>ports</I> through which Prolog may enter (<I>call</I>
and <I>redo</I> ports) or leave (<I>exit</I> or <I>fail</I> ports) the
goal. </P>

<MENU>
<LI><B>call - </B>when Prolog is initially asked to prove the goal it enters
through the <I>call</I> port. </LI>

<LI><B>exit</B> - having entered through <I>call</I>, Prolog leaves through
<I>exit</I> if it can prove the goal. </LI>

<LI><B>fail</B> - if Prolog cannot prove the goal it leaves the box via
the <I>fail</I> port. </LI>

<LI><B>redo</B> - if at some further point in the program (i.e., after
having entered through <I>call</I> and left via <I>exit</I>) Prolog backtracking
occurs then eventually (if backtracking reaches this stage back in the
proof) Prolog reenters the goal via the <I>redo</I> port. </LI>
</MENU>

<P>There is one box per goal in a program, and the boxes are linked from
port to port. Ports that we stop at in the debugger are known as &quot;debug
ports.&quot; </P>

<P>You can creep through your program from port to port, stopping at each
one. You might think of this as &quot;single stepping&quot; your program.
The debugger can stop at every CALL, REDO, FAIL and EXIT and ask what to
do next. </P>

<P>Using <A HREF="#LeashingDebugPorts">leash</A> (described later in this
section) you can limit which of the ports are stopped at. Then, when you
creep, all the ports will be displayed, but the debugger will only stop
at the ones which are leashed. For example, you might want to stop only
at CALLs and REDOs. By default, all ports are leashed when the debugger
is started. </P>

<P>Alternatively, you can &quot;leap&quot; to only the ports of predicates
specified as spypoints. You might think of this as running until a &quot;breakpoint&quot;
is reached. In this case, the intervening ports are not displayed. </P>

<P>By combining your use of creeping and leaping, you can cause the debugger
to stop at certain ports and interact with them before continuing. Thus
you can rapidly trace through code which is of no interest (because it
has already been debugged) and concentrate on a predicate or two at will.

stop the debugger at particular predicates. Execution always pauses at
a spypoint regardless of what ports are leashed and whether you are leaping
or creeping. </P>

<P>Under the Windows-IDE, you can click on the 'Spy...' button to get a
dialog box containing a list of all predicates in your program. You can
move those predicates back and forth between that list and the list of
current spypoints. </P>

<P>Under command-line alis, a spypoint is set on a predicate by using
<B>spy/1</B>. It is removed by using <B>nospy/1</B>. To remove all spypoints,
use <B>nospyall/0</B>. The current spypoints are listed by using <B>spy/0</B>.

<H2><A NAME="LeashingDebugPorts"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Leashing Debug
Ports</FONT></H2>

<P><!AMZI_INDEX = Ports; leash>As mentioned above we can either creep or
leap to a port. When we leap to a port, it is a port for a predicate that
has a spypoint set on it, and the debugger pauses to allow interaction.
</P>

<P>Creeping takes us to the ports of predicates in between the spypoints.
The debugger might pause at a port, or it may simply display it without
giving you the opportunity to interact, as execution continues. The different
behavior at ports is controlled by leashing. </P>

<P>Leashing is not related to particular predicates, as spypoints are,
but is instead a characteristic of each of the four types of ports, CALL,
REDO, FAIL and EXIT. By default, all ports have leashing turned on, so
all ports of predicates that are crept to are paused at. But leashing can
be turned off for the ports of these intermediate predicates so they display
but don't require step-by-step interaction from you. </P>

<P>Under the Windows-IDE, you can select which ports are leashed by clicking
on and off the button in front of the port name on the debugger window.
</P>

<P>Under command-line alis, you use the <B>leash/1</B> predicate to specify
the ports to make debugging ports as follows: </P>

<UL>
<PRE><FONT COLOR="#000080">?- leash(call).          % leashes all call ports
?- leash([call, redo]).  % leashes call and redo ports

?- leash(all).           % leashes all four ports
?- leash([call,fail,redo,exit]). % leashes all 4 ports</FONT></PRE>
</UL>

<P>Note that unmentioned ports are automatically unleashed. To find out
what ports are currently being leashed use <B>leash/0</B>. </P>

<P>In command-line alis, typically you will use the &quot;@&quot; debug
port option to control your leashing by entering the leash command as a
goal. </P>

<P><IMG SRC="arrowrt.gif" HEIGHT=18 WIDTH=18 ALIGN=BOTTOM> <I>Note that

predicates. </P>

<P>We start to creep through the program by typing &quot;c&quot; in command-line
alis, and by clicking on &quot;Creep&quot; in Windows-IDE. Note, we pause
only on CALL ports. Under alis, the program output is interspersed with
the debugging information. Under the IDE, they are kept in separate windows.
Here we show the command-line I/O with the program I/O shown in italics:
