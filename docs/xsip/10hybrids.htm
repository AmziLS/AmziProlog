  Two Hybrids </font></B></h1>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>This 
  chapter describes two similar expert systems which were developed at Cullinet 
  Software, a large software vendor for IBM mainframes, VAXes, and PCs. The systems 
  illustrate some of the difficulties in knowledge base design and show the different 
  features needed in two seemingly very similar systems.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>Both 
  expert systems were designed to set parameters for the mainframe database, IDMS/R, 
  at a new user site. The parameters varied from installation to installation, 
  and it was necessary to have an experienced field support person set them at 
  the site. Since field support people are expensive, the expert systems were 
  written to allow the customer to set the parameters, thus freeing the support 
  person for more demanding tasks.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>The 
  first, CVGEN, set the system generation (sysgen) parameters for the run time 
  behavior of the system. This included such parameters as storage pool sizes, 
  logging behavior, and restart procedures. These parameters had a serious effect 
  on the performance of the system, and needed to be set correctly based on each 
  site's machine configuration and application mix.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>The 
  second, AIJMP, set all of the parameters which ran an automated installation 
  procedure. This included parameters which determined which modules to include 
  and how to build installation libraries. These parameters determined how the 
  software would reside at the customer's site.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>The 
  systems were built using a variation of the pure Prolog approach described earlier 
  in the book. The inferencing parts of the system were separated from the knowledge 
  base. It was surprising to find that even with two systems as similar as these, 
  they both set parameters, the shell for one was not completely adequate for 
  the other.</FONT></P>

  CVGEN </font></B></h2>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>Various 
  shells available on the PC were examined when CVGEN was built, yet none seemed 
  particularly well suited for this application. The main difficulty centered 
  around the nature of the dialog with the user. To a large degree, the expertise 
  a field support person brought to a site was the ability to ask the right questions 
  to get information from the systems programmers at the site, and the ability 
  to judge whether the answers were realistic.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>To 
  capture this expertise, the knowledge base had to be rich in its ability to 
  represent the dialog with the user. In particular:</FONT></P>

  <DIR> 
    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>•&#9;The 
      system was designed to be used by systems programmers who were technically 
      sophisticated, but not necessarily familiar with the parameters for IDMS/R. 
      This meant fairly lengthy prompts were needed in the dialog with the user.</FONT></P>

    </FONT> 
    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>•&#9;The 
      input data had to be subjected to fairly complex validation criteria, which 
      was often best expressed in additional sets of rules. A large portion of 
      the field person's expertise was knowing what values made sense in a particular 
      situation.</FONT></P>

    </FONT> 
    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>•&#9;The 
      output of the system had to be statements which were syntactically correct 
      for IDMS/R. This meant the rules not only found values for parameters but 
      built the statements as well.</FONT></P>

    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> </P>
    </FONT> </DIR>
</DIR>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>The 
  first objective of the system was to gather the data necessary to set the parameters 
  by asking meaningful questions of the systems programmer. This meant providing 
  prompts with a fair amount of text.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>The 
  next objective of the system was to validate the user's input data. The answers 
  to the questions needed to be checked for realistic values. For example when 
  asking for the desired number of simultaneous batch users, the answer had to 
  be checked for reasonableness based on the size of machine.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>A 
  similar objective was to provide reasonable default answers for most of the 
  questions. As were the edit checks, the defaults were often based on the particular 
  situation and required calculation using rules.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>Given 
  these objectives, the questioning facility needs to have the ability to call 
  rule sets to compute the default before asking a question, and another rule 
  set to validate the user's response. It also needs to be able to store questions 
  which are up to a full paragraph of text.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>The 
  knowledge base needs to be designed to make it easy for the experts to view 
  the dialog, and the edit and default rules. The knowledge base also needs some 
  pure factual information.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>The 
  actual rules for inferencing were relatively simple. The system had a large 
  number of shallow rules (the inference chains were not very deep) which were 
  best expressed in backward chaining rules. The backward chaining was natural 
  since the experts also tackled the problem by working backward from the goals 
  of setting individual parameter values.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>Also, 
  since the system was setting parameters, uncertainty was not an issue. The parameter 
  was either set to a value or it wasn't. For this reason pure Prolog was used 
  for the main rule base.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>Pure 
  Prolog had the additional advantage of making it easy for the rules to generate 
  IDMS/R syntax. The arguments to the parameter setting rules were lists of words 
  in the correct syntax, with variables in the positions where the actual value 
  of the parameter was placed. The rules then sought those values and plugged 
  them into the correct syntax.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>The 
  rules for each parameter are stored in the knowledge base with the parameter 
  name as the functor. Thus each parameter is represented by a predicate. The

  the parameter. Variables in the list are set by the body of the predicate. A

  parameters.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>Most 
  knowledge bases are designed with askable information listed separately from 
  the rules, as in the earlier examples in the book. In this case however, the

  Explanations </font></B></h2>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>Explanations 
  become a bit more difficult with the <B>ask</B> predicate. The how questions 
  are handled pretty much as in the Clam and Native systems described earlier 
  in the book. Since why traces require overhead during the inference process, 
  and performance is a key issue for a system with a long dialog such as this 
  one, the why trace implementation is different from that in Native. The basic 
  strategy is to use pure Prolog as indicated for most of the inferencing, but 
  to redo the inference using a Prolog in Prolog inference engine to answer why 
  questions.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>In 
  order to do this the system must in fact restart the inference, but since the 
  parameters are all basically independent, the why trace need only restart from 
  the last call to set a parameter. For this reason, the <B>set_parm</B> predicate 
  writes a record to the database indicating which parameter is currently being 
  set.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>Once 
  the why trace gets into <B>ask</B>, the Prolog in Prolog must stop. In fact, 
  the question might have arisen from setting a parameter, or calculating a default 
  value, or specifying an edit criteria. Again, for these cases a flag is kept 
  in the database so that trace knows the current situation.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>The 
  why trace then starts at the beginning, traces pure Prolog inferencing until 
  it encounters <B>ask</B>. The why explanation then notes that it is in <B>ask</B>, 
  and finds out from the database if <B>ask</B> has gone into either <B>default</B> 
  or <B>edit</B>. If so it proceeds to trace the <B>default</B> or <B>edit</B> 
  code. The final explanation to the user has the Prolog traces interspersed with 
  the various junctions caused by <B>edit</B> and <B>default</B> in ask.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>This 
  system is a perfect example of one in which the explanations are of more use 
  in diagnosing the system than in shedding light on an answer for the user. Many 
  of the rules are based solely on empirical evidence, and reflect no understanding 
  of underlying principles. For this reason a separate explanation facility was 
  added to the knowledge base that would explain in English the rationale behind 
  the setting of a particular parameter.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>For

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>CVGEN 
  is also designed to handle many of the details necessary in a commercially deployed 
  system. These details include the ability to change an answer to a question, 
  save a consultation session and restore it, build and save test runs of the 
  system, and the ability to list and examine the cache and the knowledge base 
  from within a consultation. The system also includes a tutorial which teaches 
  how to use the system.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>Most

  is a bit tricky. When the user changes an answer to a question, it is almost 
  impossible to predict what effects that will have on the results. Whole new 
  chains of inferencing might be triggered. The safest way to incorporate the 
  change is to rerun the inference. By saving the user's responses to questions, 
  the system avoids asking any questions previously asked. New questions might 
  be asked due to the new sequence of rules fired after the change.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>The 
  facts which are stored are not necessarily the same as the user's response. 
  In particular, the user response of "take the default" is different from the

  AIJMP </font></B></h2>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>The 
  AIJMP system seemed on the surface to be identical to the CVGEN system. Both 
  set parameters. It was initially assumed that the shell used for CVGEN could 
  be applied to AIJMP as well. While this was in general true, there were still 
  key areas which needed to be changed.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>The 
  differences have much to do with the nature of the user interaction. The CVGEN 
  system fits very nicely into the classic expert system dialog as first defined 
  in the MYCIN system. The system tries to reach goals and asks questions as it 
  goes. However for AIJMP there is often the need for large amounts of tabular 
  data on various pieces of hardware and software. For these cases a question 
  and answer format becomes very tedious for the user and a form-based front end 
  to gather information is much more appropriate.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>AIJMP 
  uses forms to capture some data, and dialogs to ask for other data as needed. 
  This led to the need to expand the basic inferencing to handle these cases.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>Another 
  difficulty became evident in the nature of the expertise. Much of what was needed 
  was purely algorithmic expertise. For example, part of the system uses formulas 
  to compute library sizes based on different storage media. Many of the parameters 
  required both rules of thumb and algorithmic calculations. </FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>The 
  best solution to the problem, for the knowledge engineer, was to build into 
  the inference engine the various predicates which performed calculations. This 
  way they could be referred to easily from within the rules.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>Some 
  of the declarative knowledge required for AIJMP could not be easily represented 
  in rules. For example, many products depend on the existence of co-requisite 
  products. When the user enters a list of products to be installed, it must be 
  checked to make sure all product dependencies are satisfied. The clearest way 
  to represent this knowledge was with specialized data structures. Operators 
  are used to make the structures easy to work with.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="New Century Schlbk,Century Schoolbook" SIZE=2>One 
  simple example of how the custom approach makes life easier for the expert and 
  knowledge engineer is in the syntax for default specifications in the questions

  indicate that a parameter had as its default the value of another parameter. 
  This was a shorthand syntax well understood by the experts. In many cases the 
  same value (for example a volume id on a disk) would be used for many parameters 
  by default. Only a slight modification to the code allowed the knowledge to 
  be expressed using this familiar syntax:</FONT></P>
