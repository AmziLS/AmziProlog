  and Procedural Knowledge</font></h2>

<p>Traditional software tools provide two ways of encoding knowledge: one is as 
  <b>facts</b>, or data, in memory; the other is as sequences of instructions 
  coded in a <b>procedural</b> programming language such as Java, C++, Visual 
  Basic, Delphi or C#.</p>

<p>These two types of knowledge, factual and procedural, are natural for a
computer because a computer is engineered from memory (facts/data) and a
processing unit that executes a sequence of instructions (procedures). It is no
accident that database tools and procedural programming languages have been
with computers since the earliest days. It is no accident that early commercial
use of computers was called 'data processing.'</p>

<p>Consider an airline reservation system. It has factual knowledge about
passengers, flights, and bookings stored in a database. It has procedures that
manipulate that data, for example to book a passenger on a flight.</p>

<p>This type of automation is well suited to a computer's design.</p>

<h2><img src="../images/paws.gif" width="36" height="36"> <a name="logical_knowledge"></a><font color="#333333">Logical 
  Knowledge</font></h2>

<p>Logical knowledge is <b>relationships</b>. On paper, logical knowledge might 
  be expressed as rules, or in tables showing conditions and implied results, 
  or as graphs showing connections, or in formats that are particular to a given 
  application area.</p>

<p>In an airline reservation system, pricing knowledge would be logical. It is 
  a <b>complex set of rules and tables</b> describing relationships between air 
  fare and dates, places, connections, durations, class, frequent flier miles, 
  weekends, holidays, discounts, promotions and who knows what else.</p>

<p>Logical knowledge, unless relatively simple, <b>does not lend itself to easy 
  encoding</b> in a computer.</p>

<p>It doesn’t fit well in a database, because the relationships expressed are
more complex than the simple factual relationships databases can encode.</p>

<p>It doesn’t fit well in procedural code because the programmer is forced to 
  artificially express the independent logical relationships as a sequence of 
  instructions with well-defined flow of control.</p>

<h2><img src="../images/paws.gif" width="36" height="36"> <a name="traditional_tools"></a><font color="#333333">Using 
  Traditional Tools for Logical Knowledge</font></h2>

<p><img src="overview_traditional.gif" width="330" height="220" align="right" border="0">While 
  not well suited for the task, traditional tools are often used to encode logical 
  knowledge.</p>

<p>In a few cases, the traditional tools are workable. For example, if the relationships 
  are simple enough to be expressed in tables with the same columns, then a database 
  can be used effectively. If the rules fit readily in a decision tree, then that 
  tree can be represented by procedural branching statements.</p>

<p>But logical knowledge of any significance has a <b>variety of factors</b> in 
  the relationships, making them ill-suited for database; and no implied sequence 
  of execution, making them awkward to code procedurally. Different combinations 
  of rules in different sequences are required depending on the input data.</p>

<p>The <b>advantage</b> of using traditional tools is, well, that they are traditional 
  tools. There are a large number of programmers who are skilled in using them.</p>

<p>The <b>disadvantage</b> of using traditional tools is the procedural code and/or 
  fragmented collections of data tables needed to express the interrelated logical 
  relationships winds up being a rat’s nest of unwieldy, difficult to maintain 
  and highly error prone code.</p>

<p>For some application areas, this might not be a factor. But if the logical 
  knowledge is changing, and it is important to keep up with the changes, then 
  the <b>costs of maintaining </b>the encoding of the logical knowledge becomes 
  prohibitive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>More importantly, due to 
  the time consuming and error prone nature of that approach, competitive advantage 
  could well be lost.</p>

        it is used both to describe branching instructions in a procedure, and 
        certain logical relationships. In procedural code, if-then statements 
        steer the flow of control. As logical relationships, if-then rules have 
        no implied order of execution.</p>

<h2><img src="../images/paws.gif" width="36" height="36"> <a name="virtual_machines"></a><font color="#333333">Virtual<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
  </span>Machines for Logical Knowledge</font></h2>

<p><img src="overview_reasoning_engine.gif" width="350" height="300" border="0" align="right">If 
  the problem with encoding logical knowledge is the underlying machine, then 
  what’s needed to do the job right is a machine designed to handle logical knowledge. 
  Building a hardware machine is not very practical, but software can be used 
  to build a wide variety of <b>virtual machines</b>.</p>

<p>This is exactly what is done in all of the tools available for expert systems, 
  business rule systems, knowledge base systems, logicbase systems, case base 
  systems and others.</p>

<p>Each of these tools has a virtual machine architecture with two key components:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a “<b>knowledge representation</b>” syntax and interface for entering and 
    maintaining logical relationships in a file called a “<b>knowledge base</b>,” 
    and</li>
  <li>a “<b>reasoning engine</b>” that takes input data and, using the knowledge 
    base, produces answers.</li>
</ul>

  
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A pricing application has a knowledge base of pricing rules and regulations; 
    takes as input particulars of a given flight; and produces as output a fare.</li>
  <li>A support application has a knowledge base of diagnostic rules; takes as 
    input symptoms of a given problem; and produces as output a solution.</li>
  <li>A configuration application has a knowledge base of related components; 
    takes as input customer requirements; and produces as output a configured 
    assembly.</li>
</ul>

  
<p>This architecture provides the major benefit that the logical knowledge no 
  longer has to be forced into a format that is ill-served for coding it. Because 
  the logical knowledge is more <b>naturally expressed</b> in a knowledge representation 
  language, it is <b>easier to create and maintain</b>. Because it is easier to 
  maintain, it is less error-prone, more reliable, and changes can be incorporated 
  in production software much more rapidly.</p>
  
<p>In some cases the logical relations can be maintained directly by those with 
  the knowledge, avoiding the translation step through an intermediate programmer. 
  This further magnifies the benefits.</p>

<h2><img src="../images/paws.gif" width="36" height="36"> <a name="different_tools"></a><font color="#333333">Different 
  Tools for Different Applications</font></h2>
  
<p>Unfortunately, there is tremendous variety in the forms of logical knowledge 
  required for different application domains, and accordingly, there are a number 
  of different tools and approaches.</p>
<p><b>How well a given tool fits a particular application depends on how close 
  the knowledge representation language and reasoning engine match the way the 
  application logic is naturally expressed and used.</b></p>
  <p>For example, pricing knowledge is usually formal and precise, whereas knowledge 
    about technical support has more vagaries in it, and also requires support 
    for textual or HTML questions and answers.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Configuration knowledge includes rules for how components are combined 
    and also needs to express the logical relationships of hierarchies of parts.</p>
  <p>Both pricing and technical support would have reasoning engines intent on 
    finding a specific solution, but the knowledge for configuring complex products 
    needs to be applied in a building block manner, creating a complex structure 
    as output.</p>
  
<p>There are numerous <b>general-purpose tools</b> that might fit a given application, 
  or an organization might decide to build a customized tool for their particular 
  application.</p>
<p>A <b>customized tool</b> has the huge benefit that the knowledge representation 
  can be designed to specifically match the way knowledge for that application 
  is expressed. This often means those with the knowledge can directly maintain 
  the knowledge base without programmer intervention.</p>
  <p>A general-purpose tool can be purchased off-the-shelf and might provide a 
    good enough fit for the application.</p>
  
<h3><a name="spreadsheets"></a>Spreadsheets, the First Logicbase Tools</h3>
  
<p>Spreadsheets are a perfect example of a specialized tool for a specific type 
  of logical knowledge. In this case the logical relationships are arithmetic 
  formulas linking the contents of the various cells.</p>
<p>The designers of a spreadsheet program first create the pattern of cells and 
  allowable formulas users can use to express relationships.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>That is the knowledge representation.</p>
<p>They then write a program that knows how to compute the required cells in 
    a spreadsheet. That is the reasoning engine.</p>
  
<p>The logical relationships defined in the spreadsheet, such as this cell is 
  equal to the sum of those cells, are then used to compute values for different 
  inputs. The result is financial users can directly enter the types of relationships 
  they deal with in a familiar manner, without requiring a programmer. The underlying 
  spreadsheet engine does the computation for them.</p>
  
<p>As we all know, spreadsheets are tremendously popular because they let non-programmers 
  encode logical relationships that are executed by the spreadsheet reasoning 
  engine. Of course, they are limited to expressing the sorts of things you can 
  express in an array of related cells and formulae.</p>
  <h3><a name="knowledgebases"></a>Knowledgebases, the Next Logicbase Tools</h3>
  
<p><img src="overview_logicbase.gif" width="330" height="180" align="right" border="0">There 
  are many general purpose expert system tools and business rule products that 
  follow the same architecture. They provide a knowledge representation for entering 
  logical relationships as rules, and a reasoning engine that knows how to execute 
  those rules.</p>
  <p>These tools are powerful and are often used to solve the problem of encoding 
    logical relationships.</p>
  <p>The degree to which they are successful is related to how closely the semantics 
    of the particular logical relationships are to the given tool. When the tool 
    does not fit particularly well, then often, programmers are still needed to 
    code the relationships for the tool.</p>
  <p>This means those with the know-how don’t maintain the logicbase directly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>On the other hand, this is a better solution than using traditional 
    tools because the programmer is now working with declarative specifications 
    of the logical relationships rather than forcing them into procedural code.</p>
  <p>The result is faster, more reliable response to changing conditions.</p>
  <h3><a name="logicbases"></a>Prolog, Pure Logic</h3>
  
<p><img src="overview_prologbase.gif" width="330" height="180" align="right" border="0">Prolog 
  is a tool that has a reasoning engine that takes as input formal logical assertions 
  of facts and relationships. It’s knowledge representation is ideal for precise 
  sorts of relationships, such as those found in regulations and definitive business 
  rules.</p>
  
<p>Prolog logic can be compiled for fast execution, and the Prolog reasoning engine 
  is well suited for access from other applications, making it easy to access 
  a logicbase in an application.</p>
  
<p>Prolog has the advantage over most tools in that it is an ISO standard language 
  with many vendors providing compatible implementations.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>While not as widespread as Java or C++, many 
  programmers have had some exposure to Prolog.</p>
  <h3><a name="hybrid_logicbases"></a>Hybrid Logic System</h3>
  
<p><img src="overview_hybrid.gif" width="330" height="240" border="0" align="left">For 
  application areas where those with the know-how prefer less formal syntax for 
  representing logical relationships, it is not difficult to create front-end 
  maintenance tools that translate a more informal representation into high performance 
  Prolog syntax.</p>
  
<p>For example, developers might provide a spreadsheet or database front-end that 
  allows those with know-how to enter rules and relationships. </p>
<p>That is then translated into a back-end Prolog logicbase for production.</p>
  <p>The result is a hybrid system that provides many of the advantages of an 
    application-specific logicbase, with a reliable, high-performance, general 
    purpose logic reasoning engine for deployment.</p>
  
<h3><a name="application_specific_knowledgebases"></a>Application-Specific Knowledgebases</h3>
  
<p>Application-specific knowledgebases have tremendous advantages for those cases 
  where they are cost-effective. They provide a very powerful tool for those with 
  the know-how to use, and deployment without requiring programmer intervention.</p>
<p><img src="overview_logicprogram.gif" width="330" height="180" border="0" align="right">The 
  result is fast reliable turn around of the business logical knowledge in response 
  to changing business environments. The trade-off is development cost, as it 
  takes time and money to design and build a custom knowledge representation and 
  reasoning engine.</p>
<p>Prolog can greatly reduce the cost of building these custom tools. In addition 
    to its easily learned and used formal logicbase capabilities, Prolog supports 
    more advanced logic programming. </p>
  <p>Logic programming is an extremely powerful programming technology ideally 
    suited for implementing custom tools for maintaining and deploying logical 
    knowledge.</p>
  <p>While Prolog’s easily learned pure logic is limited in its application to 
    knowledge that is formal in nature, using logic programming, it is almost 
    trivial to design knowledge representation formats for an infinite variety 
    logical knowledge.</p>
  
<p>In a fraction of the time and code it would take using traditional programming 
  technologies, logic programming can be used to implement reasoning engines that 
  provide any sort behavior a particular application requires.</p>

        called meta logic, because with logic programming it is easy to create

      <p>It takes some learning for a programmer to become skilled at logic programming, 
        but once learned, allows for very rapid development of specialized knowledge-base 
        tools.</p>
      <p>The advantages to this approach are immense. It allows for the customization

<p>A subset of Amzi! Prolog provides an easily learned and used syntax for expressing 
  logical relationships directly as pure <b>logical assertions</b>. Together these 
  assertions form a logicbase that can be queried much as a database can.</p>
<p>Because such a logicbase is &quot;pure&quot; logic it is best suited for application 
  areas where the rules and relationships are crisp and <b>well defined</b>. Examples 
  include regulations, such as for taxes or insurance forms, and business rules, 
  such as for pricing, underwriting or workflow.</p>
<p>The Amzi! Logic Server allows the logicbase to be deployed on the Web or as 
  part of a stand-alone application. It can run on Windows or Unix operating systems 
  and connect directly to software written in languages such as Java, C++, VB, 
  C# and Delphi.</p>
<p><img src="../images/amzisquirrel.gif" width="120" height="120" align="right">Prolog 
  syntax can also be generated from other forms of logical knowledge. If those

<p>In addition to supporting logicbases for directly representing logical relationships, 
  Amzi! Prolog supports full logic programming capabilities.</p>
<p>Logic programming is ideal for <b>modelling any sort of knowledge and its use</b>. 
  Logic programming might be called meta logic, because it uses logical statements 
  to describe general properties and behaviors of the domain being modelled.</p>
<p>Because logic programming is an extension of Prolog logicbase capabilities, 
  it can be used to enhance logicbases with extra functionality. It can also be 
  used to create entirely new applications for representing and reasoning over 
  specific types of knowledge.</p>
<p>Some examples of logic programming applications are intelligent tutorials, 
  broadcast scheduling, product configuration, pattern-matching for customers/suppliers, 
  pattern-matching for mines and output, natural language, and grammar rules for 
  message translation.</p>
<p>For applications involving knowledge representation and reasoning, logic programming 
  often yields greater than a <b>ten to one improvement in productivity</b> when

  with Weather Shield.</p>

<p><a href="../customers/digxpr_satellite.htm">DigitalXPress</a> schedules real-time 
  streaming video, multicasts and large data transfers via satellites. Their high-performance 
  scheduler, a logic program, creates the <b>schedule in real-time</b> as prioritized 
  requests are entered.</p>
  
<p><a href="../customers/eotek.htm">eoTek</a>, a supplier of mortgage services 
  for Nexstar, maintains separate knowledgebases of <b>pricing and underwriting</b> 
  rules. They switched from a pure Java approach to a hybrid logicbase approach, 
  gaining faster turnaround of pricing/underwriting changes, shorter test cycles, 
  increased reliability, and high performance. This gives Nexstar a competitive 
  edge in mortgage services.</p>
  
<p><a href="../articles/youbet.htm">Youbet.com</a> supplies <b>dynamic Web content</b> 
  for the horse racing enthusiast. It has separate logic program and logicbase 
  that describe how content is extracted from a large and changing set of suppliers, 
  for example various race tracks around the World. This lets them quickly provide 
  the latest services for their customers.</p>
  
<p><a href="../articles/cchlis_formspub.pdf">CCH</a> uses a hybrid logicbase approach

<h2><img src="../images/paws.gif" width="36" height="36"> <a name="benefits_features"></a><font color="#333333">Summary 
  of Benefits</font></h2>
<p>These are the primary benefits of the Amzi! approach to deploying logical knowledge, 
  helped with some metrics from a customer that kept good statistics.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Automate 'difficult' components</b> - Logicbases can easily implement 
    application components that are 'difficult' using conventional tools. Typically 
    they are difficult because they are specified as sets of interrelated rules 
    and relations that are too complex for database, yet are not easily expressed 
    in procedural languages. Because a logicbase is composed of non-procedural 
    logical relations and rules, this type of application is very easy in Prolog. 
    For example, one user replaced 5000 lines of Java code that implemented complex 
    pricing rules, with 500 lines of Prolog logic.</li>
  <li><b>Bring business logic closer to those who know it best</b> - Logicbases 
    can often be maintained directly by those who maintain the business rules. 
    This is sometimes due to the declarative nature of Prolog, and sometimes to 
    the ease with which Prolog can represent various types of knowledge. For example, 
    the pricing component used to require Java programmers to implement changes, 
    now a hybrid front-end allows those changes to be directly handled by pricing 
    experts.</li>
  <li><b>Greater Reliability</b> - Logicbases can be independently tested and 
    debugged, before integration, making for quicker, more error-free implementation. 
    Also the often factor of ten reduction in code means there is simply less 
    code to go wrong. The pricing component has been virtually error-free.</li>
  <li><b>High Performance</b> - Logicbases execute extremely fast. This is because 
    the declarative Prolog logic is compiled to run on a specialized Prolog virtual 
    machine. Dynamic Prolog logic is indexed for high performance. The pricing 
    component takes up an insignificant portion of a total pricing transaction.</li>
  <li><b>High Volume Use</b> - Logicbases are ideal for Web deployment. Multiple 
    simultaneous logicbase engines can be run in multiple threads. The pricing 
    application maintains a pool of Logic Servers, serving online demand.</li>
  <li><b>Rapid Development</b> - Components are developed in a fraction of the 
    time required using procedural languages and database. Developers don't worry 
    about procedural flow-of-control or memory allocation issues, concentrating 
    instead on pure application logic. The pricing application took two years 
    to develop in Java, but less than two months in Prolog.</li>
  <li><b>Easy Integration</b> - Logicbase components can be deployed as part of 
    any application context. The Amzi! Logic Server API provides interfaces for 
    popular languages and environments. The pricing component is part of a Java 
    real-time Internet service.</li>
  <li><b>Highly Portable</b> - Amzi! logicbases can be run on most any computing 
    environment. Compiled logicbases are machine independent, running on a Prolog 
    virtual machine. The pricing component was moved without change between Solaris 
    and Windows NT servers.</li>
  <li><b>International Applications</b> - Logic-bases can be deployed in any national 
    language, using either Unicode or locale-specific multi-byte character sets. 
    The pricing application is in English. An erosion advisor was developed and 
    deployed in Chinese.</li>
