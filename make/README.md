# *Amzi! Prolog + Logic Server* Make Files
### amzi-apls-make

This project contains the top-level make files for the various environments supported by *Amzi! Prolog + Logic Server*.  Note that Amzi! is an extremely portable system that has been ported to many different environments, and the three contained here are just the ones for which there are current build files.

See the amzi-apls-devdocs project for details on using them to build the system.

For building on Windows, the GNU gmake.exe utility is included.
